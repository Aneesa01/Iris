# Iris
Our main aim is creating a classifier for a set of Iris flowers.

1) We split the dataset into the 80% training and 20% test datasets.
2) We split the training dataset into each class.
3) We calculated the mean and standard deviation of each attribute for each class.
4) We calculated the probabilities of each attribute for all the flowers.
5) We calculated the probabilities of each attribute given that we know the class of the flower.
6) We defined the function which contained the Naive Bayes classifier.
7) We calculated the accuracy of the classifier and plotted 3 Roc Curves corresponding to each class.
